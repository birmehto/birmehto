- Identified specific failure types (404, DNS, timeout)
- Categorized by link type and importance

### Formatting Validation Process
- Analyzed markdown structure and syntax
- Tested mobile compatibility patterns
- Checked accessibility compliance
- Evaluated cross-platform rendering compatibility
- Generated compatibility scores for each platform

## Conclusion

The README has excellent content quality and visual appeal, but requires significant fixes to external links and minor formatting improvements for optimal cross-platform compatibility. The broken project links are the highest priority issue, as they directly impact the professional credibility of the profile.

**Overall Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS ATTENTION** - Content is excellent, but technical issues need resolution before the README can be considered fully functional.
